          Objective : <br />
          - The goal of Pig is to be the first player to reach or exceed a
          predetermined point total, typically 50 points.
          <br />
          Equipment : <br />
          - You need a standard six-sided die and a method for keeping score,
          such as pen and paper or a scorekeeping app.
          <br />
          Starting the Game : <br />
          - Decide who goes first, typically by rolling the die with the highest
          number, or by mutual agreement. <br />
          - The first player begins their turn by rolling the die.
          <br />
          Taking Turns : <br />
          - On a player's turn, they roll the die and accumulate points based on
          the value rolled. <br />
          - The player can continue rolling as long as they want, adding the
          value of each roll to their turn total. <br />
          - At any point during their turn, the player can choose to stop
          rolling and add the accumulated points to their overall score.
          <br />
          Scoring : <br />
          - Points are accumulated during a player's turn and added to their
          overall score when they choose to end their turn. <br />
          - If a player rolls a 1, they lose all points accumulated during that
          turn, and their turn ends immediately. <br />
          - Rolling a 1 also passes the turn to the next player.
          <br />
          Winning : <br />
          - The first player to reach or exceed the predetermined point total
          (usually 50 points) wins the game. <br />
          - If multiple players reach the winning point total in the same round,
          the player with the highest score wins. <br />
          - The game ends immediately once a player wins.
